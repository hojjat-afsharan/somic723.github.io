This is for test
typing test
I am trying to learn how to type with my 10 fingers 
At first it was so hard for me to type even in 20 words per minute 
But after a lot of exercise it became easier than before
Althought I should exercise even more
I am trying so hard.
I saw a web page named Typing Club
It is awesome 
I learn very useful skills
One of best characteristics of this website is its statistics
Every time you repeat an exercise it shows charts about your current try and you can comprise them with 
your previous tries!
It gives me enthusiastic feeling in typing
